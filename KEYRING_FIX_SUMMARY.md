# üîê XFCE Container Keyring Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå **Container Crashes**
**Problem**: The Dockerfile was trying to install hundreds of packages (Unity, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS CLI, etc.) which was causing:
- Build timeouts
- Container startup failures  
- Resource exhaustion
- Dependency conflicts

**Solution**: ‚úÖ **Streamlined the Dockerfile** to install only essential packages:
- XFCE desktop environment
- VS Code and Chrome
- Essential keyring packages (`gnome-keyring`, `libsecret-1-0`, `libsecret-tools`)

### 2. ‚ùå **Keyring Error: "OS keyring is not available for encryption"**
**Problem**: VS Code couldn't access the OS keyring for secure credential storage

**Solutions Applied**: ‚úÖ
- Added `gnome-keyring`, `libsecret-1-0`, and `libsecret-tools` packages
- Created proper `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` setup in launch script
- Added automatic `gnome-keyring-daemon` startup with secrets, ssh, and pkcs11 components
- Created keyring session initialization script with autostart
- Added diagnostic script to test keyring functionality

### 3. ‚ùå **Chrome Won't Start**
**Problem**: Chrome's sandbox doesn't work in containerized environments

**Solution**: ‚úÖ Created desktop shortcuts with container-safe flags:
- `--no-sandbox` for Chrome
- `--disable-dev-shm-usage` and `--disable-gpu-sandbox`
- Proper user data directories

## Files Modified

1. **`apps/xfce/build/Dockerfile`** - Streamlined from 300+ lines to ~80 lines
2. **`apps/xfce/build/scripts/launch-comp.sh`** - Added keyring initialization with logging
3. **`apps/xfce/build/scripts/keyring-session-init.sh`** - Wolf-compatible keyring startup
4. **`apps/xfce/build/scripts/test-keyring.sh`** - Diagnostic script for testing
5. **`build-xfce-enhanced.sh`** - Updated build script

## Next Steps

### Build the Container
```bash
./build-xfce-enhanced.sh
```

### Test Keyring Functionality
```bash
docker run --rm -it local/xfce-enhanced:latest /opt/gow/scripts/test-keyring.sh
```

### Update Wolf Configuration
Use image: `local/xfce-enhanced:latest` in your Wolf config

## Expected Results
- ‚úÖ Container starts successfully (no more crashes)
- ‚úÖ VS Code keyring error resolved
- ‚úÖ Chrome starts properly
- ‚úÖ Desktop shortcuts work with container-safe flags
- ‚úÖ GNOME keyring properly initialized for credential storage

## Why This Works
1. **Minimal Package Set**: Only essential packages, eliminating conflicts
2. **Wolf-Compatible Paths**: Uses `/tmp/user/$(id -u)` for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
3. **Proper Keyring Init**: Ensures gnome-keyring-daemon starts with all components
4. **Container-Safe Applications**: Uses `--no-sandbox` flags where needed
5. **Diagnostic Tools**: Includes testing to verify keyring functionality
