A lightweight desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems with pre-installed development tools.
It aims to be fast and low on system resources while being visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Pre-installed Development Applications

This enhanced XFCE desktop comes with essential development tools pre-installed:

### üéÆ **Game Development**
- **Unity Hub** - Unity game engine management platform
- **Steam** - Gaming platform for testing and playing games

### üíª **Development Tools**
- **Visual Studio Code** - Modern code editor with extensions support
- **Google Chrome** - Web browser for web development and testing
- **Git** - Version control system
- **Node.js & NPM** - JavaScript runtime and package manager
- **Python 3** - Programming language with pip package manager

## Installing applications

In this configuration, XFCE is set up to use **Flatpak in user mode** by default.  
Flatpak is a software utility for software
deployment, package management, and application virtualization for Linux. By using Flatpak in user mode, users can
install and manage applications from the Flatpak store without needing administrative privileges or modifying the base
Docker image.  
This setup enhances flexibility and security, as users can add or remove applications independently of the
underlying system.

### Additional Software Installation

You can install additional software using multiple methods:

1. **APT Package Manager** (with root access):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install package-name
   ```

2. **Flatpak Applications**:
   ```bash
   flatpak install flathub application-name
   ```

3. **Snap Packages**:
   ```bash
   sudo snap install application-name
   ```

4. **AppImages** - Just download and run
5. **Manual Installation** - Full root access for custom software

## Persistent Data Storage

The container includes persistent volume mounts for:

- **`/home/retro`** - Complete user home directory
- **`/home/retro/Projects`** - Development projects storage
- **`/home/retro/Unity`** - Unity projects and assets
- **`/home/retro/.config/Code`** - VS Code settings and extensions
- **`/home/retro/.local/share/Steam`** - Steam games and data
- **`/shared/projects`** - Shared project directory

All data persists between container restarts and updates.
