# Prism Launcher

[Prism Launcher](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher) is a custom launcher for Minecraft that allows you to
easily manage multiple installations of Minecraft at once.

## Known issues

When the image starts, it thinks to be in fullscreen and the mouse pointer could be messy, to fix this open the terminal
and type exit to close it.
The issue is present only in the launcher once, when the game is in fullscreen mode everything is fine.

Controller support also works 100% with `Controllify`, youâ€™ll still need keyboard+mouse for first setup but after that
mouse mode on the controller is enough to start minecraft.
